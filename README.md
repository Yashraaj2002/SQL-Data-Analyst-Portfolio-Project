# üìä SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project

Welcome to my SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project!  
This project showcases core analytical techniques and reporting skills used in real-world business intelligence work, covering everything from trend analysis to customer and product reporting.

---

## üìÅ Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive SQL-based analysis that demonstrates the use of various analytical techniques and reporting formats using structured business data (such as sales, transactions, and customer profiles).

The goal is to derive actionable insights that help drive decisions across marketing, operations, and sales.

## üß† Key Analytical Techniques Used

## üîç Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This section focuses on uncovering initial patterns, trends, and summary insights from the data using foundational SQL techniques.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Database Exploration
- Explored the overall structure of the database.
- Identified all tables and their relationships using schema inspection queries.
- Reviewed columns, data types, and constraints to understand the dataset context.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dimensions Exploration
- Focused on analyzing dimension tables (e.g., Customers, Products, Categories).
- Verified the uniqueness and completeness of primary key columns.
- Checked for hierarchical or categorical groupings used for segmentation.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Date Range Exploration
- Determined the earliest and latest dates available in transactional or event-based tables.
- Helped define the time span of data availability for accurate trend analysis.
- Identified gaps or irregularities in temporal data.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Measures Exploration (Key Metrics)
- Calculated key aggregated values such as totals, averages, and counts.
- Provided quick insights into volume and central tendencies of business activities.
- Useful for detecting high-level patterns and anomalies.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Magnitude Analysis
- Quantified and grouped data across dimensions such as region, category, and customer type.
- Helped understand which segments contribute most to key measures like sales or quantity.
- Used `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and aggregate functions (`SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`).

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Ranking Analysis
- Ranked entities such as products or customers by performance metrics like sales or frequency.
- Identified top performers and underperformers.
- Applied window functions like `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, and `ROW_NUMBER()` for detailed sorting.


## üìà Part 2: Advanced Analytics

This section includes deep-dive analyses designed to answer strategic business questions, track KPIs, and produce detailed performance reports.

Advanced analytics includes:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Change Over Time
- Analyzed how a measure (e.g. sales, orders) evolves over time.
- Used to identify trends, patterns, and seasonality in the business.
- Enables better forecasting and capacity planning.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Cumulative Analysis
- Aggregated metrics progressively over time (e.g. cumulative sales).
- Helps understand long-term business growth or decline.
- Useful for measuring momentum or identifying plateaus.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Analysis
- Compared current values to target benchmarks.
- Used to measure success against business goals.
- Supported performance reviews and operational feedback loops.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Part-to-Whole Analysis
- Evaluated how individual components (e.g. categories, products) contribute to the overall.
- Helps identify which areas have the most impact on revenue or performance.
- Drives strategic focus on high-impact segments.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Segmentation
- Grouped data based on defined ranges (e.g. age groups, spending bands).
- Allowed identification of patterns and correlations between two or more variables.
- Key to personalizing campaigns and strategies.
