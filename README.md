# 📊 SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project

Welcome to my SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project!  
This project showcases core analytical techniques and reporting skills used in real-world business intelligence work, covering everything from trend analysis to customer and product reporting.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive SQL-based analysis that demonstrates the use of various analytical techniques and reporting formats using structured business data (such as sales, transactions, and customer profiles).

The goal is to derive actionable insights that help drive decisions across marketing, operations, and sales.

## 🧠 Key Analytical Techniques Used

### 1️⃣ Change Over Time
- Analyzed how a measure (e.g. sales, orders) evolves over time.
- Used to identify trends, patterns, and seasonality in the business.
- Enables better forecasting and capacity planning.

### 2️⃣ Cumulative Analysis
- Aggregated metrics progressively over time (e.g. cumulative sales).
- Helps understand long-term business growth or decline.
- Useful for measuring momentum or identifying plateaus.

### 3️⃣ Performance Analysis
- Compared current values to target benchmarks.
- Used to measure success against business goals.
- Supported performance reviews and operational feedback loops.

### 4️⃣ Part-to-Whole Analysis
- Evaluated how individual components (e.g. categories, products) contribute to the overall.
- Helps identify which areas have the most impact on revenue or performance.
- Drives strategic focus on high-impact segments.

### 5️⃣ Data Segmentation
- Grouped data based on defined ranges (e.g. age groups, spending bands).
- Allowed identification of patterns and correlations between two or more variables.
- Key to personalizing campaigns and strategies.

### 6️⃣ Measures Exploration (Key Metrics)  
- To calculate aggregated metrics (e.g., totals, averages) for quick insights.
- To identify overall trends or spot anomalies.

### 7️⃣ Magnitude Analysis
- To quantify data and group results by specific dimensions.
- For understanding data distribution across categories.

### 8️⃣ Ranking Analysis
- To rank items (e.g., products, customers) based on performance or other metrics.
- To identify top performers or laggards.
